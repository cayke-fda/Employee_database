# Employee_database
Small logistic regression model to analyze different things in an Indian company and understand what are the main factors that lead people to leave it.

For this problem I used the databse present in the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset

After cleaning and working on the data I was able to answer the following questions:

What is the distribution of educational qualifications among employees?
How does the length of service (Joining Year) vary across different cities?
Is there a correlation between Payment Tier and Experience in Current Domain?
What is the gender distribution within the workforce?
Are there any patterns in leave-taking behavior among employees?
